# C&I Solar Market Entry Strategy — UAE Free Zones

This repository presents a structured, consulting-style market entry strategy for the Commercial & Industrial (C&I) rooftop solar segment across major free zones in the United Arab Emirates. The project evaluates whether a mid-sized EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) firm should enter this market— and, if so, how to do it competitively and sustainably.

The analysis covers market drivers, customer economics, competitive dynamics, free zone prioritization, strategic positioning, risks, and a 12-month execution roadmap. All deliverables are designed in a format consistent with management consulting workstreams.

## 🧭 Key Insights (High-Level)

- The C&I segment in UAE free zones demonstrates strong structural attractiveness driven by high solar resource, favorable economics, and ESG commitments by tenants.  
- A clear **mid-market quality gap** exists between large EPCs (who focus on >1 MW projects) and small installers (who compete on price).  
- **JAFZA** emerges as the most compelling starting point due to rooftop availability, tenant stability, and operational fit.  
- A **CAPEX-led, quality-focused entry model** supported by financing partners is the optimal initial strategy.  
- Execution feasibility is strong with manageable risks over a 12-month phased rollout.
